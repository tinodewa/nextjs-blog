The "Simple One Page Web" project aims to build a simple yet visually appealing website with a single homepage. The site will utilize interactive features such as local scroll for smooth navigation, parallax effects for visual depth, Bootstrap carousel to display content in rotation, attractive header icon animations, and image overflow effects for a unique look. By combining HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, this project will produce a responsive and user-friendly website while still maintaining performance and accessibility.
